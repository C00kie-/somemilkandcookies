BEGIN TO LEARN JAVASCRIPT AND NODE

Hi there, ok. I discover the NodeSchool. Here you’ll find tutorials for Javascript (bases), and Node and other cool stuff. I recommend the tuto javascripting for anyone who begins with coding too. It’s really bases of syntax. For discovering more fonctionalities of the language go on KhanAcademy, for a small training it’s also good to visit CodeAcademy.

All are free.
