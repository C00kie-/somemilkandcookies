Why do we use an async code ?

–> https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook#why-you-should-use-streams

tutorials I found useful to help understanding, an preparing your own code :

Stream-adventure on NodeSchool.io, you easily install it by doing :

npm install -g stream-adventure

(node installed already)
